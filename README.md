this is a python program that lets you create reddit accounts
it is semi automatic, you still need to fill the captcha, vpn not included

step 1. download python 3.10 and download this repository as a zip (on where it says Code)

step 2. download chrome

step 3. download https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home and put it into the folder you downloaded this

step 4. run and fill the captcha

if console doesnt give any errors, just exists and doesnt trow lots of nonsense stuff, congratulations! you just created an account successfully
after that dm VolleierYouKnow#8140 with the contents inside namesforreddit.txt
